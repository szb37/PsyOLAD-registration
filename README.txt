This repo is associated with the preregistration of the 'Psychedelic therapy vs. open-label antidepressant treatment' project.
AsPredicted.org preregistration: https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=35V_DWY

This repository adds to the preregistration by specifying the models that will be used, see PsyOLAD_analysis_v2.Rmd.
We note that shortly after the date of the registration (5th September 2023), we updated the frequentist models (13th Sept 2023; see ). 
No data was collected between the original registration date and updating the frequentist models. 
The models at the time of the original registration can be found in the 'analysis v1' folder.
